# Spring-eshop
Traditional server rendered e-commerce store built on Spring Framework for learning purposes. [Live demo here](https://shoepp.herokuapp.com)

### TECHNOLOGIES:
* Java 8
* Spring framework (Sping boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA/Hibernate, Spring Security)
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap
* jQuery

### FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURES:
* User register/login with role based authorization.
* Admin portal for CRUD operations on products (only accessible by admin user).
* Store: display all products, filter products by price, category, size or brand, order results by different criteria or filter by search input.
* Purchasing: view details of product, add to shopping cart, checkout, place order with shipping address and payment info.
* Create and edit user profile, view orders history.
* Responsive design.


### Aditional info
The data was taken from MercadoLibre.com public API using a simple python script. 
I uploaded both the script (might not be reusable in the future without modifications) 
and the sql dump in case someone needs to import a working database. 
All the images were originally links to cloud resources but I decided later to serve them as static assets for simplicity.
